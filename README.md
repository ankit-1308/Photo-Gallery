# HTML/CSS Photo Gallery

This project is a simple implementation of a photo gallery using HTML and CSS. It allows users to view a collection of photos with titles and descriptions displayed in an overlay on hover.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery is designed to work on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Hover Overlay**: When hovering over a photo, an overlay appears displaying the title and description of the photo.
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions are applied to the images and overlays for a better user experience.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/html-css-photo-gallery.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Browse through the photo gallery, hover over photos to view their titles and descriptions.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the photo gallery.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing the styles for the photo gallery layout and appearance.
- Images: Add your photos to the project folder and update the `src` attribute of the `<img>` elements in the HTML file accordingly.

## Customization

- **Adding Photos**: To add more photos to the gallery, duplicate the `<div class="photo">` section in the HTML file and update the `src` attribute of the `<img>` element with the path to your photo. Also, update the title and description content in the overlay.
- **Styling**: Feel free to customize the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file to match your preferred design and layout.
